# GCMS-decoding-effort

The purpose of this document is to present a summary for crowd-sourcing restoration of the Mars Viking Lander GCMS digital data set. 

Introduction to Mars Viking Landers: 
The Viking Landers were the first successful landers on Mars in 1976. The main objective of the Viking Landers was to search for life in the martian surface soil. 

Search for martian organics:
The gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometer (or GCMS) instrument performed an organic inventory of the martian soil, but found no organics, the basic building blocks of life as we know it. Scientists were surprised and disappointed. However, recent Mars landers have found new information, which suggests that organics could have been masked due to the constraints of the instrument. This warrants a reanalysis of the original Viking GCMS data. 

Current state of GCMS data:
The Viking GCMS data exists today as 1) bar graphs on 16-mm microfilm, and 2) full and reduced versions of the data stored as binary data. The digital data (2) is undocumented and unreadable, and it is the purpose of this repository to crowdsource the decoding effort. 

Overview of data set: 
The fundamental data generated by the Viking GCMS instrument are mass scans from the mass spectrometer.
